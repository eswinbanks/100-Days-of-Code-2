# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 13 May, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started on SoloLearn C# Tutorial. 

**Thoughts:** I have gone through the first section which is talking about basic concepts, this includes variables, printing text, comments, var keyword, constants, arithmetic operators and increment operators. I also took the quiz at the end which was 5 questions which I got all right.

### Day 2: 14 May, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Carried on with the next segment of SoloLearn.

**Thoughts:** Went back through the quiz from yesterday to see if I can get the same score. I did get the last question wrong but after going back through my notes for arithmetic operators I was able to solve the problem with the 2nd try. Here is the question:
```csharp
What is the output of this code?
int x = 15;
int y = 6;
x %= y;
Console.WriteLine(x);
```
Moving onto the next segment on SoloLearn is covering conditionals and loops. I got through if-statements, switch statements and while loops. Tomorrow I will be looking at for loops, do-while loops and break and continue. 

### Day 3: 15 May, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Carried on looking at conditionals and loops.

**Thoughts:** Finished the conditionals and loops segment including the quiz. I had to make a note of the different logical operators and try and remember what the outcome by making basic examples. Here is one of the examples:
```csharp
bool a = true;
bool b = true;

if (a && b) {
Console.WriteLine("Condition is true");
```

### Day 4: 18 May, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Conditionals and loops - Logical operators, conditional operator, building a basic calculator and the module 2 quiz. 

**Thoughts:** As I have had a couple of days that I have missed I will be making back the time for the next couple of days. It has been a good learning about the different types of logical operators as it is useful with shortening code down. I have been struggling with logical operators and will look at these a bit more in depth using a different site to see if I can make sense of it.


### Day 5: 19 May, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I have went back to do a bit more research into logical operators and even went as far as making my basic test
