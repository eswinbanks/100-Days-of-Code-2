# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 13 May, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started on SoloLearn C# Tutorial. 

**Thoughts:** I have gone through the first section which is talking about basic concepts, this includes variables, printing text, comments, var keyword, constants, arithmetic operators and increment operators. I also took the quiz at the end which was 5 questions which I got all right.

### Day 2: 14 May, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Carried on with the next segment of SoloLearn.

**Thoughts:** Went back through the quiz from yesterday to see if I can get the same score. I did get the last question wrong but after going back through my notes for arithmetic operators I was able to solve the problem with the 2nd try. Here is the question:
```csharp
What is the output of this code?
int x = 15;
int y = 6;
x %= y;
Console.WriteLine(x);
```
Moving onto the next segment on SoloLearn is covering conditionals and loops. I got through if-statements, switch statements and while loops. Tomorrow I will be looking at for loops, do-while loops and break and continue. 

### Day 3: 15 May, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Carried on looking at conditionals and loops.

**Thoughts:** Finished the conditionals and loops segment including the quiz. I had to make a note of the different logical operators and try and remember what the outcome by making basic examples. Here is one of the examples:
```csharp
bool a = true;
bool b = true;

if (a && b) {
Console.WriteLine("Condition is true");
```

### Day 4: 18 May, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Conditionals and loops - Logical operators, conditional operator, building a basic calculator and the module 2 quiz. 

**Thoughts:** As I have had a couple of days that I have missed I will be making back the time for the next couple of days. It has been a good learning about the different types of logical operators as it is useful with shortening code down. I have been struggling with logical operators and will look at these a bit more in depth using a different site to see if I can make sense of it.


### Day 5: 19 May, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Operators re-cap and introduction to methods. 

**Thoughts:** I have went back to do a bit more research into logical operators and even went as far as making my basic test which I will eventually uplaod to here if I knew how to do. Moving onto an introduction to methods, method parameters, multiple parameters, optional and named arguments. Tomorrow I will be looking at finishing the methods section.


### Day 6: 20 May, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finish the segment on methods.

**Thoughts:** During this I have learnt passing arguments, methods overloading, recursion, making a pyramid and the methods quiz. Tomorrow I will be going through the previous lessons and making an example for each section with comments which will get upload here. 


### Day 7: 21 May, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Make some test examples in Visual Studio

**Thoughts:** Started going through and recapping some of the segments that I have already done and make some examples. So far I have made a dew examples from the basic concepts  (comments, arithmetic operators, getting user input) and I have also started making some examples from the conditionals and loops (if and switch statements, while and for loops). It has been good to go back through to try and remember what was done and how to apply it to my code. 


### Day 8: 22 May, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finish making examples.

**Thoughts:** I have finished the examples for segment 2. I need to go back through segment 3 which is methods and make examples for these. This is has included examples for the do-while loop, break and continue, logical operators (in the form of a basic calculator) and conditional operators. 


### Day 9: 23 May, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Start on Classess and Objects.

**Thought's:** I have taken a break from making examples until I have finished this segment and then I will go back. In this part I have learnt about classess and objects, value and reference types, encapsulation, constructors and properties. 


### Day 10: 25 May, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Arrays and Strings.

**Thought's:** Another day missed which is a shame but I am going to be catching up with the days miss and make sure I keep getting reminders for the next days. For today I am going to me looking at arrays and strings and in here it includes the likes of using arrays in loops, array properties and methods, multidimensional arrays and jagged arrays. 


### Day 11: 26 May, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Arrays

**Thought's:** So I didn't fully understand arrays so instead of moving onto the next part I have spent this time to understand arrays before moving on. I am starting to understand it more the more I look into it and use examples in VS.


### Day 12: 27 May, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Examples.

**Thought's:** I have been setting up some examples for each of the different modules so far to see how much I can remember and going abck through and using different sites to see if they explain it in a different way. Examples that I have made so far is classes and objects, value and reference types, encapsulation, constructors and looked at properties.


### Day 13: 28 May, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Examples

**Thought's:** Following on from yesterdays examples I have made a few more examples around arrays to see what I looked at the other day has sunken in. This includes arrays, using arrays in loops, multidimensional arrays and array properties and methods.


### Day 14: 29 May, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More on Classes

**Thought's:** Today I will be looking at more on classes in this I will be looking at destructors, static members, static classes, this and readonly, indexers and operator overloading.
